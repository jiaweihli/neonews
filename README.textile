h2. Neonews

Neonews is intended to be a replacement for html4nntp.  With a fresh new interface and the addition of some crucial features, it'll be the new web portal to newsgroups.

h2. Usage

Start by instantiating a newsgroup object via @NeoNews.NewsGroup.NewsGroup(site, username, password)@.
Call @setGroup(group)@ and @listGroups()@ on the newsgroup.
Call @setThread(threadID)@ and @listThreads()@ on the group.

h2. Notes

After using v2.x-compatible nntplib, the code seems to run slower?
