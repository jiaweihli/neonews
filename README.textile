h2. Neonews

Neonews is intended to be a replacement for html4nntp.  With a fresh new interface and the addition of some crucial features, it'll be the new web portal to newsgroups.

h2. Notes

Neonews currently requires Python v3.2, which is in beta.  A workaround for this will be implemented soon.
